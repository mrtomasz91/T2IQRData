# T2IQRData
Data share repository for manuscript: T2 heterogeneity provides a sensitive measure of early tumor response to radiotherapy
Each folder includes tumors in the corresponding treatment group, each in an individual .mat (MATLAB data library) file. The file includes T2 maps and tumor region of interest masks, as well as the quantified histogram features in order as follows: skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, mean, median, interquartile range.
The metrics were calculated taking all voxels within the tumor mask.
